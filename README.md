# ESP32 Firmware Core

Minimal, reusable firmware core for ESP32-based projects.

This repository contains a working MVP (~80% functional) that serves as a clean baseline for further development, refactoring, and feature expansion.

---

## Project Status

- MVP / Early stage
- Core functionality working
- Ongoing refactoring and cleanup
- Not production-ready yet

This project is intentionally published early to demonstrate architecture, structure, and development approach.

---

## Motivation

The goal of this project is to build a clean, modular firmware foundation for ESP32 projects that can be reused across multiple applications.

Instead of starting from scratch for each project, this repository aims to provide:
- a solid baseline
- clear separation of concerns
- extensibility for future features

---

## Features

This section will be extended over time.

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3
- Feature 4

## Repository Structure

```
esp32-firmware-core/
├─ src/
├─ include/
├─ components/
├─ CMakeLists.txt
├─ README.md
└─ ...
```

(The structure may change during refactoring.)

## Usage

This repository is intended as:
- a reference implementation
- a starting point for ESP32 projects
- a technical portfolio project

Build, flash, and usage instructions will be added once the core structure is stabilized.
